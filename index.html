					<h2>About Coal states</h2>
					<p>"Coal and coal producing states have always been there for us since the revolutionary days. These states could still be the basket of the nation for the next fifty years. As the 46th President, i'll sponsor a Congressional charter, that would allow federally owned corporations 
					to be set up in these states - all the way to the Gulf coast and California, and to operate hand in hand with these states. Focus will be to use the creation of small businesses, technology, water farming and millennial defense structures to spur the creation of 
					local jobs, new careers, plus a vigorous economic activity/development in the areas of material technology, agriculture, natural disaster control new energy, transportation, land allocation (by bonds) Also, the education in each of these regions would be made 
					to reflect the need of local schools, trade and technical schools, and higher institutions. Good thing is these middle American states have modified charters that were crafted after old English settlement charters.  I'll therefore borrow a page of Shakespears King Lear's 
					story, conduct and personal relationships to solve their problem.  That's why the Founding Fathers never went anywhere without the English Bard's."</p>

					<h2>The future of our defense</h2>
					<p>Long endurance weapons, fast air-borne platforms and different types sud-surface weapons with passive anti-buoyancy capability are the biggest threat to the American homeland now.  And they are nowhere to be found than in the hands of aliies and foes in the Pacific. To counter these
					we need a new military with a new mindset and a totally new doctrine. We need newly conceived weapons, new weapon platforms and new technology and a totally different approach to face this type of challenge. All we have as at know are Reagan-era weapons. They are good for defending Europe 
					and the Middle East, but not in the Pacific theater. In line with the Charter and the Bye Laws of The PILGRIMS Alliance and ReBuildUSAtoday, i'll build a new millennium capable military for the United States.  I'll set up new capabilities for our combined armed forces and improve on education for Veterans.</p>

					<h2>Foreign policy we support</h2>
					<p>As our candidate for President said, "put an end to Islamic Arabism of the middle east by revisiting San Remo resolution.  Use this resolution to bring back a process of 3R’s – reckoning, recognizing and re-introducing 
					displaced ethnic communities back to their ancestral homes in the middle east.  …say, Mesopotamians, Phoenicians and the people of Levant, back to their ancestral homes like we did the Jews, back to the land of Israel.
					Start a campaign to make the region (Middle East) nuclear free. And all designated heritage sites, weapon free. Please note, Iran is not in the Middle East, so it is not affected by this policy.
                                        For now, the creation of a Christian space in the Middle East is important. For this, I have my site set on the Sinai Peninsula and the Negev. I will use American power to create and secure this 
					Biblical heritage enclave for persecuted Christians all over the Middle East to migrate to. And as said before, rather than give aid to Israel and Egypt, I will use it to create a Christian state 
					between both countries with the strait of Tiran and Saudi Arabia to the south of it.</p>

			Dear American,
		</p>

		<p>
			RebuildUSA.today is a heritage focused movement, a hybrid PAC and a socio-political welfare organization that organically arose out of the need to politically engage young Americans and involve first time voters in our political process more than ever.  We believe it is possible to RebuildUSAtoday and we believe this is the best time to do it.  We also believe the best way to do it is by embracing technology 
			more than we do now.</p>  
			
			<p>That is why we partnered with The PILGRIMS Alliance Party of the United States (be a PAL) in their campaign to vigorously ReBuildUSAtoday with technology. Upgrade aging infrastructures nationwide. Create smart cities. Deploy ambience technology and ambience intelligence all over the United States. And also to get every single American to embrace the new age of American energy.</p>		
	
			<p>As at now, no single “builder” exists; instead, RebuildUSA.today is made up of individual groups (Radical Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Millennials, Libertarians, Greens and Working Families Party) who share common values about repurposing America, rebuilding America and reshaping America’s values – with respect for security, the original meaning of the Constitution, fiscal responsibility, and most of all returning 
			political power to the will of the American people.</p>
			
			<p>For now we are offering a platform that not only provide support but also encourage Veterans to run for 3078 county, state and congressional seats. We cannot do it all alone.  We need your help to enable grassroots support for women, teachers, young graduates, farmers and field a new generation of young, dynamic Americans from all backgrounds as candidates for 3078 seats for on-coming elections - from 2018 onwards.</p>
	
			<p>So if you are interested in running for an office, please feel free to fill out the form on our website or contact us via email.  If you are a Veteran, a Sergeant, a Master Sergeant or a proud possessor of a Presidential Warrant, please step forward and sign up with us - to run for Congress or sponsor other Veterans who chose to run for office on our ticket.</p>
	
			<p>You can also volunteer or donate to help us in our quest to engage and to serve the American people. And don’t forget to make it a duty to inform fellow friends, family, colleagues and co-workers about this campaign.</p>

			<p>Sincerely,</p>

			<p>Abbey Samuel Laurel-Smith</br> 
			Founder, Chair and Acting Secretary</br>
			ReBuildUSAtoday and The PILGRIMS Alliance Party of America (La Alianza De Peregrinos de los Estados Unidos)</br>
			<font color="red">We need campaign offices, local branches and access to debate venues nationwide.<br/>
