					<h2>The future of coal states</h2>
					<p>"Coal and coal producing states have always been there for us since the revolutionary days.These states could still be the basket of the nation for the next fifty years. As the 46th President, i'll borrow a leaf from King Lear's Shakespeare - 
					sponsor a Congressional charter and public land bonds, that would allow federally owned corporations in these states (from middle America, to the Gulf coast, and California. Focus will be to use the creation of small businesses, technology, 
					water farming and the developments of millennial defense structures. These will will spur creation of local jobs, new careers and enliven a vigorous economic activity/development in the areas of material technology, agriculture, 
					natural disaster control, new energy and transportation. Also, the education in each of these regions would be made to reflect the need of local schools, trade and technical schools, and higher institutions."</p>

					<h2>The future of our defense</h2>
					<p>Long endurance weapons, aerial/spectrum denial platforms and different types sub-surface weapons with passive anti-buoyancy capability are the biggest threat to the American homeland now. 
					And they are in the hands of aliies and foes in the Pacific. To counter these I propose a new military, a new mindset and a totally new doctrine. We need newly conceived weapons, new weapon 
					platforms and new technology to face this type of challenge. All we have as at know are Reagan-era weapons. They are good for defending Europe and the Middle East. But are they good in the Pacific, 
					No? Are they good for the homeland, No?.</p>

					<h2>Millennial economy we support</h2>
					<font color="grey"><p>The American civil war showed us how important small businesses are, and still is, to the growth of this nation. Small businesses create varieties of jobs in local comunities.
					And because they do not ship jobs abroad, neither do they outsource services, small businesses, manufacturers and service providers could help stimulate economic recovery in areas 
					with high unemployment rate. As Preident, i'd rather give tax breaks to small businesses and their inovations than big corporations.</p>

					<h2>Foreign policy we support</h2>

					displaced ethnic communities back to their ancestral homes in the middle east.  …say, Mesopotamians, Phoenicians and the people of Levant, back to their ancestral homes like we did the Jews, back to the land of Israel.
					Start a campaign to make the region (Middle East) nuclear free. And all designated heritage sites, weapon free. For now, the creation of a Christian space in the Middle East is important. I will set up one in the

					<h2>Waterfarming is the new oil</h2>
					<p>From now on water from yearly hurricane and flooding of the southern and some midwestern states will be treated as a gift of nature and an asset we could use to replace oil. Mega-reservoirs, mega-drain-pipelines
					and state of the art water collection and treatment system will turn yearly "disaster water" into something California, Texas, New Mexico, Utah and Arizona farmers could tap into - in times of drought. Treated water pipelines 
					running up to the north and north west corner of America could turn non-agricultural states into a pastural land. Same pipeline could be used to supply fresh water to 3billion people in Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. If we 
					remove the fear of annual disastrous flooding, southern states like Florida, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas would counduct business all year long - without fear of disruption.</p>

			Dear American,
		</p>

		<p>
			RebuildUSA.today is a heritage focused movement, a hybrid PAC and a socio-political welfare organization that organically arose out of the need to politically engage young Americans and involve first time voters in our political process more than ever.  We believe it is possible to RebuildUSAtoday and we believe this is the best time to do it.  We also believe the best way to do it is by embracing technology 
			more than we do now.</p>  
			
			<p>That is why we partnered with The PILGRIMS Alliance Party of the United States (be a PAL) in their campaign to vigorously ReBuildUSAtoday with technology. Upgrade aging infrastructures nationwide. Create smart cities. Deploy ambience technology and ambience intelligence all over the United States. And also to get every single American to embrace the new age of American energy.</p>		
	
			<p>As at now, no single “builder” exists; instead, RebuildUSA.today is made up of individual groups (Radical Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Millennials, Libertarians, Greens and Working Families Party) who share common values about repurposing America, rebuilding America and reshaping America’s values – with respect for security, the original meaning of the Constitution, fiscal responsibility, and most of all returning 
			political power to the will of the American people.</p>
			
			<p>For now we are offering a platform that not only provide support but also encourage Veterans to run for 3078 county, state and congressional seats. We cannot do it all alone.  We need your help to enable grassroots support for women, teachers, young graduates, farmers and field a new generation of young, dynamic Americans from all backgrounds as candidates for 3078 seats for on-coming elections - from 2018 onwards.</p>
	
			<p>So if you are interested in running for an office, please feel free to fill out the form on our website or contact us via email.  If you are a Veteran, a Sergeant, a Master Sergeant or a proud possessor of a Presidential Warrant, please step forward and sign up with us - to run for Congress or sponsor other Veterans who chose to run for office on our ticket.</p>
	
			<p>You can also volunteer or donate to help us in our quest to engage and to serve the American people. And don’t forget to make it a duty to inform fellow friends, family, colleagues and co-workers about this campaign.</p>

			<p>Sincerely,</p>

			<p>Abbey Samuel Laurel-Smith</br> 
			Founder, Chair and Acting Secretary</br>
			ReBuildUSAtoday and The PILGRIMS Alliance Party of America (La Alianza De Peregrinos de los Estados Unidos)</br>
			<font color="red">We need campaign offices, local branches and access to debate venues nationwide.<br/>
